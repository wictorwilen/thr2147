Many companies manually configure their Microsoft Teams areas over and over again. This is tedious work and almost a guarantee that they don't have the teams set up in a similar way. With the help of Microsoft Graph and the new Microsoft Teams APIs, companies can now turn this into an automated procedure with scripting or code. This session shows how the new APIs can help and how they can help orchestrate your Microsoft Teams setup and configuration in order to create a consistent experience across teams. Expect to see more scripts and code than slides!
